## About

The Need for Sleep Study (NFS) was a National Medical Research Council, Singapore National Research Foundation, Singapore and Far East Organization sponsored study that relied on a parallel group design which analyzed the effects of sleep restriction (7 nights of 5 hour time in bed [TIB]) on cognitive performance, subjective sleepiness, and mood in healthy 15-19 year adolescents. This study was conducted from 2010-2019 and included polysomnography data collection and actigraphy collection.

The NFS dataset includes 4 protocols. All the protocols were conducted during the 15-day school vacation period. The NFS1 and NFS2 protocols were conducted from 2014 to 2015. NFS4 was conducted during the vacation period of 2017, and NFS5 was conducted during the same period in 2019. All protocols had similar participant counts: NFS1 had 60 participants, NFS2 had 57 participants, NFS4 had 58 participants, and NFS5 had 59 participants. During these 15-day study periods, a series of experimental studies aimed at characterizing adolescents’ cognitive functions under different sleep manipulations were conducted.

Alongside the experimental studies, raw polysomnography data was collected. Raw PSG data was collected using a SOMNOtouch recorder (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) from two channels (C3 and C4 in the international 10–20 system).
